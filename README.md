# Windows10 Rickroll
 
#### Hey! Look at you! You're actually reading the REAMDE! Most people fail to do that!

Hello World! This was a project that I started because I was bored and just wanted to have some fun!

There are two automatic rickrolls included in this project, one which will launch on startup and one that will launch instead of task manager. I realize that not having task manager can be pretty damning to programmers, so I decided to allow the user to choose which of the two components they wanted to install or uninstall.

To install or uninstall the rickroll functionality from your Windows10 Device, download the latest release and run the "installer.vbs" and "uninstaller.vbs" to install or uninstall the automatic rickrolls respectivly.

Hope you all have a great day :)
